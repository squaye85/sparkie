My coldfusion Bloging software. Getting a lot of inspiration from Wordpress.

Finally settling for CFWheels as my CFML framework of choice.

For the frontend, I'll be checking out Twitter bootstrap. This will be for the admin part of the blog engine.

The usuals, Jquery and other js frameworks included.
